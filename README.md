==========

realtime 2d and 3d (like wolfenstein) ray tracing with opengl/sdl around simple shapes

space key to switch between 2d and 3d views

controls are a bit like in a fps game :

  arrow key to move

  mouse to view around



the 2d view displays the point of view as a light source that casts shadows behind the shapes

you need opengl and SDL1.2 libs with the include files in /usr/include

to build, go in the root folder of the repository, then:

mkdir bin

make

to execute, go in bin dir, then: 

./app
